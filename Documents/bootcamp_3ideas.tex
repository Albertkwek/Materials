\centerline{\Large \bf Thinking about data}
\bigskip

\begin{itemize}

\item Data + Picture = a compelling way to tell a story

\item Where we're headed
\begin{itemize}
\item Think of a {\bf graph\/} you'd like to produce -- a ``visualization''
\item And the {\bf story\/} it tells
\item And the {\bf data\/} that went into it
\end{itemize}

\item Examples (links on {\it Topic outlines \& links\/} page) [Gapminder]

\item Questions about graphs
\begin{itemize}
\item What did you learn, what is the {\bf story\/}?
\item {\bf What else} would you like to know?
\item Where did the {\bf data\/} come from?
\end{itemize}

\item Examples revisited, answer the questions

\item Course projects
\begin{itemize}
\item Course structure:  tools, project
\item Opportunity to show off your skills (Projects directory of GitHub repo)
\item First step:  develop project ideas ({\bf ideas are developed, not discovered})
\item What interests {you}? (finance? movies?  soccer?)
\end{itemize}

\item Idea machines
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with an idea or subject (what interests you?)
\item Start with a dataset (you'll know more shortly)
\item Start with an example (see link on data page)
\item Start with a suggestion from the people you work with
\end{itemize}

\item Three ideas
\begin{itemize}
\item Put red sticker on your computer
\item Goal:  write down three ideas, 1-2 sentences each (see handout)
\item Use your imagination, don't overthink it (improv: what's your name?)
\item Talk to your neighbors, bounce ideas around
\item Or look at the {\it Data sources\/} page of the course website
\item When you're done, switch to green sticker
\item Share an idea with the class, ask for suggestions for developing further
\item Save ideas for future reference
\item Optional:  leave a copy with me
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
{\it Write down three project ideas, a sentence or two each. We'll use them for class discussion.
Save for later, they're a head start on coming up with a project idea.}
